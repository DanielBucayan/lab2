Black, a shade so mysterious.
It can be something depressing or something gorgeous.
Depressing as the heart break from someone you really love,
Or as gorgeous as the starry night sky above. 

Black can be quite scary.
It can resemble the feeling of being so empty.
The feeling of being all alone,
And being stuck in a place that is dark and unknown. 

Black also resembles the cold night.
Welcomes us after a long fight during daylight.
Greets us with the cold breeze of the wind
Helps us rest, so that tomorrow we will be, once again, determined. 

Black. Just like my life before I met you.
Everything's pitch black, can't see any beautiful view.
It is a good thing that I met you while searching randomly.
Now, because of you, an angel, everything is bright and so heavenly.

    <h2 class="poem-title" onclick="togglePoem('silentThoughts')">Silent Thoughts</h2>
    <pre class="poem-content" id="silentThoughtsPoemContent">
Staring at the crowd of people around. 
Observing what makes them happy and sound.
Trying to mimic the joy etched in their face,
But I can't seem to understand. My smile seemed out of place. 

Hiding these scars is one of the many reasons,
Of why I don't go out and cherish the seasons.
I am frozen by the cold memories, I can't seem to move on.
I can't even muster the strength to face the light of dawn. 

I try to fit in, but my broken pieces don't match the crowd.
I try to talk, but my voice speaks words with unspoken loud.
I wish to join in, but i'm too scared to be focused on and seen.
I wish I knew how, but I guess I don't fit those kinds of scenes. 

The world may never see what's happening under the shell. 
Just like how one can never see what's at the end of a well.
It might be deep. It might be shallow. It might be hard for me to swallow.
I guess i'll keep holding on for now. Don't worry, i'll be just fine with my shadow.

    <pre class="poem-content" id="allHadGoneStalePoemContent">
Holding on to a piece of memory.
Like a broken glass, it deeply cut me.
Even though I'm bleeding and it hurts so bad.
Letting go is not one of the options I had. 

Slowly bleeding out, everything went pale.
The wonders and the experiences, all had gone stale.
The wind blew nothing in return, just coldness of winter.
The fallen leaves of autumn were reduced to nothing but cinders. 

The luminescent fireflies started to disappear.
And the deafening silence is the only thing I can hear.
My senses are slowly fading. I am lost in the beginning.
I slapped myself too many times only to find out I'm not dreaming. 

Drifting aimlessly in the darkness, with no horizon to gaze.
And everything felt like an impossible, unending maze.
Who could've thought that things could end up this worse.
Just by holding on tightly on the broken memories that brought happiness at first.
