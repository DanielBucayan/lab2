<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hello!</h3>
<p>Meet the man behind the experiences and emotions found in each of the poems you 
just read. Hi! I'm Daniel P. Bucayan, a BSCS-SS221 student in Asia Pacific College, 
who also has a passion when it comes to writing, writing poems at least. I'm still new 
to the world of poetry, and I'm still exploring the magical worlds that are hidden 
between the pages and the lines of each poems. Come join my adventure as I venture 
through different worlds and try different types of poetry, and support me by reading 
my creations and give me suggestions in the suggestions tab.  You can also suggest 
topics or words that you want me to write about in case you are interested on my takes 
regarding said words or topics. I hope you'll have a wonderful time reading!</p>
